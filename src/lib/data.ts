  heroDescription: `Hello! My name is Jovany Leon.

I have just 4+ year of experience in computer science development and I aspire to enter the software engineering or IT field. I am currently a student at Drexel University who studies computer science focusing on Web design and development where I aim to graduate in 2028.

Independently, I work on side projects for close connections of mine that range from creating websites for their businesses to designing social media platforms that lead to links that I also design. I work on my more technical skills with the free aid of Leetcode and Codecademy to practice for tricky interview questions that might arise.

At Drexel University, I am taking courses to help expand my growth on more programming languages and technical skills but also productivity and team development such as Programming I & II which focus in Python, and Agile Design 1 and 2 which prepare me for proper work ethic and etiquette, respectively. Even though currently studying Python, my independent work demands I also be proficient in basic front-end development languages like HTML, CSS, and some JavaScript.`,
